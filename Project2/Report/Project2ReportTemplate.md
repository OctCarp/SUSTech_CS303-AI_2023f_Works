# CS303 Project2 Report 

A report should at least include the following sections. The order given here is suggested but optional. You can re-organize it as long as the expected information is presented.

## Subtask 1


### 1. Introduction

1. Give a general introduction to the subtask 1. 
2. State the purpose of this subtask.


### 2. Methodology 

1. Algorithm/model design. 
   - Describe the baseline(or your own) algorithm/model with pseudo-code/flow charts/diagrams. 
   - **DO NOT paste (edited) Python code**.
2. Analysis. Discuss, for example, the optimality and complexity of the algorithm, and what is the deciding factor of its performance.

### 3. Experiments 

1. Metrics： how to measure your performance
2. Your Experimental results:
3. Try to find through the experiments:
     - the effect of different models (if any)
     - the effect of hyperparameters (if any), e.g., the learning rate.
     - Analyze the effect of different models and hyperparameters if you have corresponding experiments.

  
### 4. Further thoughts

Further thoughts on how it can be improved if you have enough time.


## Subtask 2


### 1. Introduction

1. Give a general introduction to the subtask 2.

### 2. Methodology 

1. Algorithm/model design. 
   - Describe which algorithm/model used in the baseline(or your own) algorithm/model with pseudo-code/flow charts/diagrams. 
   - **DO NOT paste (edited) Python code**.
2. Analysis. Discuss, for example, the optimality and complexity of the algorithm, and what is the deciding factor of its performance.

### 3. Experiments 

1. Metrics： how to measure your performance
2. Your Experimental results:
3. Try to find through the experiments:
     - the effect of different models (if any) or the similarity metric
     - the effect of hyperparameters (if any).
     - Analyze the effect of different models and hyperparameters if you have corresponding experiments.
